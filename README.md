# Striker

A straight old vertical shooter I wrote in 2002 as an easter egg for a
boring business web site.

## Disclaimer

As this is from 2002, it's rather out-dated. So, if you want to do something
similar, I'd recommend to start with something more up to date like
[Prototype4](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/prototype4/)
or
[Z-Type](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/z-type/).
