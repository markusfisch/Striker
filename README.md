Striker
=======

Striker is a high striker in form of a straight old vertical shooter.

It's a silly little game that was originally done in 2003 as an easter egg
for a boring business site.

As this is from 2003, it's rather out-dated. So, if you want to do something
similar, I'd recommend to start with something more up to date like
[Prototype4](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/prototype4/)
or
[Z-Type](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/detail/z-type/).
